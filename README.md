# Vue Simple Print

This is a Vue2 plugin (easily upgradeable to support Vue3+, just open an issue if the need is there I will do it) that allows you to easily print contents of a specified element. The element **can** be hidden either through `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` and the plugin will still print the contents of the element.
